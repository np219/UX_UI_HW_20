          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            ESI’s current website is in a very outdated layout and is difficult
            to scan. The pages are unattractive, uninteresting, and the content
            is either not up to date or difficult to search for. Visitors felt
            unsure that they could trust the organization and questioned its
            legitimacy. Nothing compelled users to take action and make a
            donation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below are example pages of the current ESI website: outdated,
            disorganized, unappealing. The website also has an area of margin on
            the right side that has no content at all on nearly every page.

          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>
            As a team, we saw an opportunity to update the website that will
            provide updated information and attract users to want to learn more
            about the organization and its efforts. To do so, the top goals for
            the project were to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Place emphasis on the Mission Statement</li>
            <li>
              Make the endangered species page more eye-catching and
              informative.
            </li>
            <li>Create a unique color scheme and modern visual design</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!--Research section using responsive img component-->
      <p class="font-bold text-uppercase mt-4">research//</p>
      <p>
        We analyzed the organization’s website in addition to its social media
        so that we could get to know ESI. Once we understood as much as we could
        find out about ESI and its mission, our team created a google survey to
        find potential stakeholders. The survey had basic questions about
        demographics, but we mostly focused on questions about animals, the
        environment, and any previous experience with donating to similar
        causes. We narrowed the results to six people who are passionate about
        wildlife and were able to hold interviews with them about the ESI
        website.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a mapping session of user responses, we quickly saw a pattern that
        users were unimpressed with the layout of the site, the use of photos
        (and overall aesthetic), as well as the navigation. These negative
        feelings led most of the participants to question the legitimacy of the
        organization.

      <img
        src="images/Affinity Diagram.jpg"
        class="img-fluid"
        alt="Responsive image"
      />
      <p>
        We then designated a user persona to guide us in our design decisions.
        The persona helped us to empathize with ESI’s audience and set the tone
        for our priorities in how we were going to capture their attention and
        gain their confidence.

        src="images/UserPersona.png"

      <p class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase mt-5">define//</p>
      <p>
        Since our persona, Taylor, is very passionate and involved in the
        environmental community, he wants to do a lot of research before
        determining if the organization is trustworthy and making a donation.
        Keeping that in mind, we created a task flow of how Taylor would go
        about navigating and researching ESI through its website before taking
        any action to support the organization.
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/User Flow.jpg"
        class="img-fluid mt-4"
        alt="Responsive image"
      />
      <p>
        Based on what we know about our delegated persona, our team rapidly
        brainstormed ideas from his point of view through the “I like, I wish,
        What If...” Method. We then placed the ideas into a feature
        prioritization matrix, keeping both ESI and the persona’s wants in mind.
        We decided to focus the redesign on the starred items, and if we had
        time we would tackle the other issues to further improve the user
        experience.
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/Feature Prioritization.png"
        class="img-fluid"
        alt="Responsive image"
      />
      <p class="mt-4">
        Now it’s finally time to put our ideas on paper and wireframe the new
        and improved design for ESI. Individually we created simple wireframes
        for how we thought the homepage should look. I did wireframe #1, and my
        team members did wireframes #2 and #3. We all had great ideas that we
        combined into one wireframe. Our teamwork resulted in a great starting
        point and gave us direction for how to style the other pages we wanted
        to showcase: “Our Mission”, “Endangered Species”, and “Donate”.

        We then iterated the lo-fi wireframe into a mid-fi prototype to get a
        better feel of how the layout would interact with users visiting the
        site. Due to the tight deadline, we decided to divide and conquer. We
        individually worked on the wireframing and prototyping for the other
        pages that we wanted to showcase, and then we would meet up to make any
        revisions together prior to performing usability testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I volunteered to tackle the donations page, which felt like it had the
        most interaction design because of the donation form and was really fun
        to create. One of my shining moments was coming up with the idea to
        include ESI’s awards, the Seal of Transparency, and 2020 Top-Rated
        Non-Profit, within the donations page. Placing them here made a lot of
        sense as it might increase the donor’s confidence in the organization.
        My team really liked the idea and I was so happy! Here is a preview of
        the final donations page and the flow of the form itself.
      </p>
      <div class="donate">

          src="images/Donate.png"
          class="img-fluid"
          alt="Responsive image"

      </div>
      <p class="font-bold text-uppercase mt-4">prototype-testing//</p>
      <p>
        Once we had our mid-fi desktop wireframes designed, we also created the
        correlating mobile screens and prepared both web and mobile prototypes
        for usability testing. A total of three participants tested the
        prototype.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we received a lot of good feedback, one of the major issues we
        came across was the "Donate" button in the top navigation. A few test
        participants noted that the button doesn't stand out and they had to get
        to the donations page through the menu items. This was an issue we knew
        we had to fix for the most obvious reason: the organization could
        potentially miss out on intended donations if users are unable to find
        the page. To fix this, we made changes to the button, making it more
        prominent.
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/DonateCTA.png"
        class="img-fluid"
        alt="Responsive image"
      />
      <p class="mt-4">
        Our solution was to color the button to differentiate it from other
        navigation content, but we weren’t ready to commit to a color. We
        decided to do a coloring session and came up with individual ideas. I
        wanted to use colors that compliment the professional tone of the
        organization and won’t clash with the vibrant images that we were using.
        I inserted some colors and finally arrived at color tones that are more
        cool tone and muted . Can you guess which colored page was mine? You got
        it, the middle one. We voted and discussed what we liked in each example
        and ended up going with my colors and another teammates idea to put a
        heavy divider between each section. In the example on the right, it’s
        the yellow bar across the page.
      </p>
      <div class="colors">
        <img
          src="images/homepage color v1.png"
          class="img-responsive"
          alt="Responsive image"
        /><img
          src="images/homepage color v3.png"
          class="img-responsive"
          alt="Responsive image"
        /><img
          src="images/homepage color v2.png"
          class="img-responsive"
          alt="Responsive image"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Even though we liked what we came up with, we did receive some feedback
        during the prototyping phase that the website would look fine and would
        benefit without additional colors because it may look too distracting.
        The feedback was given without seeing the colors we had come up with, so
        in our final usability test, we wanted to let the potential users
        decide. We did an A/B test on color vs. no color on three participants.
        We were delighted that 3/3 liked the color version!
      </p>
      <p class="font-bold text-uppercase mt-4">final prototype//</p>
      <p>
        As a result of our final A/B testing, we decided to go with the color
        scheme. We then continued to build out the rest of our style guide, and
        applied it to the individual pages. This was a smart way for us to keep
        consistent with the designs, fonts, and colors and also saved us a lot
        of time during our stand-ups and working sessions. We were able to use
        our time wisely and focus on other important design decisions.

            <h3>The Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              Because we were limited on time, we were unable to build out
              additional pages. To further develop the website, we want to build
              out the “Projects” page of the website. It is very important to
              the organization to communicate to donors about the latest
              projects and work in the field. This would be a space to build
              trust through transparency in their work. We also want to update
              the staff information page with current members of the
              organization so interested users can make contact easily. We also
              thought it would be fun to create a page with educational
              resources for students to learn more about protecting endangered
              species and the environment.

            <p class="font-bold text-uppercase mt-4">What I learned//</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Understand the stakeholders. Empathizing with the organization’s
                mission as well as potential donors helped me understand their
                goals and fueled my passion to create something that would be
                impactful and meaningful.
              </li>
              <li>
                Insert my creative solutions. I contributed some great ideas
                that the team liked. I know it might not always work out that
                way, but unspoken ideas will never become real things.
              </li>
              <li>
                Let the users define the direction of the design. It’s easy to
                be biased about what we think works, but if it doesn’t work for
                the user then there must be a better design solution to achieve.
